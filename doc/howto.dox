@page howto How to write a Finite State Machine

@tableofcontents

This document is intended as a short guide for writing an FSM using
@p nimbro_fsm2. It will cover creation of a ROS package depending on
@p nimbro_fsm2, defining your FSM & driver types, and creating states.

@section howto-ros-package Creating a ROS package with nimbro_fsm2

Create your ROS package as usual (e.g. using
`catkin_create_pkg NAME nimbro_fsm2` or from scratch). Make sure it depends
on @p nimbro_fsm2 in your `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt`.

We recommend the following directory layout:

    my_package
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    ├── package.xml
    ├── src
    │   ├── control.cpp # Your 'driver' object
    │   ├── control.h
    │   ├── fsm.h # Definition of FSM types
    │   └── states
    │       ├── drive # Use subdirectories to group states
    │       │   ├── around_panel.cpp # A single state definition
    │       │   ├── around_panel.h
    │       │   ├── search.cpp
    │       │   ├── search.h
    │       ├── valve
    │       │   ├── detect_valve.cpp
    │       │   ├── detect_valve.h
    │       ├── wait_start.cpp
    │       ├── wait_start.h

Note that we do not follow the usual ROS convention of having a separate
`include` folder --- that would be more confusing when you have a lot of states.

@section howto-types Defining your FSM & driver types

For passing information between states, @p nimbro_fsm2 offers two possibilities,
each with their own advantages and drawbacks:

 * **Constructor arguments:** States can pass arbitrary information to successor
   states via the successor state constructor. This technique is very flexible
   and does not violate encapsulation.
   However, *dynamic* transitions, such as requested through the @p nimbro_fsm2
   GUI, cannot provide these arguments. Thus, states requiring constructor
   arguments are excluded from dynamic transitions.
 * **Driver object:** You can also store arbitrary information in a global
   *driver* object. This is especially suitable for remembering discovered
   information, like object poses. On the other hand, storing information
   like this introduces *state*, which is not represented by the FSM model.

The entire FSM is templated on your driver class. It is highly useful to
introduce typedefs for your code. Usually, this is done in a central `fsm.h`
file (see above):

@code{.cpp}
#ifndef MY_FSM_H
#define MY_FSM_H

#include <nimbro_fsm2/fsm.h>

class Control;
using FSM = nimbro_fsm2::FSM<Control>;
using Transition = FSM::Transition;

#endif
@endcode

@note The typedef above does not require full definition of your driver class
  (in this case named `Control`). A forward declaration like above suffices.
  Use this feature to keep compilation times low!

@section howto-state Creating a state

States are usually defined in their own header and implementation files
(see above for file layout). Each state is represented by a custom class,
derived from @ref FSM::State. A state declaration might look like this:

@code{.cpp}
#ifndef MY_FSM_DRIVE_AROUND_PANEL_H
#define MY_FSM_DRIVE_AROUND_PANEL_H

#include "../../fsm.h"

// Forward declaration of other states for transition
namespace valve { class DetectValve; }

namespace drive
{
// Forward declaration of another state for transition
class Search;

class AroundPanel : public FSM::State<AroundPanel,
	FSM::Transitions<valve::DetectValve, Search>>
{
public:
	Transition execute(Control& driver) override;
};

}

#endif
@endcode

As you can see, @ref FSM::State has two template parameters. The first one
needs to be set to your state class. This helps the compile-time introspection
to properly detect your class name, among other benefits. The second parameter
specifies the *allowed* transitions from this state.

@note Again, for transition specifications, the states only need to be
  forward-declared. Otherwise, we would have problems with cyclic transitions.

Finally, we override the @ref FSM::State::execute method to tell the FSM what
to do once we are in that state.

An implementation for this state might look like this:

@code{.cpp}
#include "around_panel.h"
#include "search.h"
#include "../valve/detect_valve.h"

namespace drive
{

Transition AroundPanel::execute(Control& driver)
{
	// Are we there?
	if(...arrived...)
		return transit<valve::DetectValve>();

	// No idea where to go?
	if(...lost...)
		return transit<Search>();

	issue drive commands...
	return stay();
}

}
@endcode

The two primitives @ref FSM::State::transit and @ref FSM::State::stay allow us
to control the FSM execution.


@section howto-control Running the FSM

The only piece missing is the `Control` class. We start with a very basic
definition in `control.h`:

@code{.cpp}
#ifndef CONTROL_H
#define CONTROL_H

#include "fsm.h"

class Control
{
public:
	Control();

	void work();
private:
	FSM m_fsm;
};

#endif
@endcode

and the corresponding implementation:

@code{.cpp}
#include "control.h"

#include <ros/init.h>

#include "drive/around_panel.h"
#include "drive/search.h"
#include "valve/detect_valve.h"

Control::Control()
 : m_fsm(*this) // give the FSM a reference to the driver object
{}

void Control::work()
{
	// Initialize the ROS interface. Here, we have to give a list of the
	// possible entry states as template parameters.
	m_fsm.initialize<drive::AroundPanel>();

	// Set the start state
	m_fsm.setState<drive::AroundPanel>();

	// .. and go!
	ros::Rate rate(ros::Duration(1.0));
	while(ros::ok())
	{
		m_fsm.step();
		rate.sleep();
	}
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	ros::init(argc, argv, "my_fsm");

	Control control;
	control.work();

	return 0;
}
@endcode
